### US - English Version (Repository Description)

Background statement:

Due to the Chinese Communist Party's data censorship policies, even terms such as "AI", "model training", "AI algorithms", "algorithm monitoring", and "datasets" are often treated as sensitive keywords. As a result, I created this repository.


1. This repository is a **private backup space for model and data files** produced during my daily AI development work.
2. It is used solely for **research, development tracking, and versioned storage** of training results.
3. As an AI developer, I frequently generate large numbers of intermediate outputs, datasets, and model checkpoints. All content stored here is directly related to machine learning projects I work on, and is either authored, generated, or organized by me. There is no illegal, infringing, or inappropriate material hosted in this repository.
Final and cleaned versions of selected models may be released publicly on platforms such as Hugging Face or in my public GitHub repositories.
4. **Please do not interpret this repository as misuse of GitHub Releases or a file dump**.
5. **If there's ever any concern about the repository's usage or content, please contact me by email before taking any action**: 📧 imomb.top@gmail.com | 🌱 I am fully willing to cooperate with any request to restructure, remove, or migrate content in order to remain compliant with GitHub's Terms of Service. **Please avoid directly suspending the repository**. Thank you very much for your understanding and support 🙏



### 🇨🇳 中文版本说明

背景说明：

由于中共对于我的数据审查，甚至 "AI、模型训练、AI算法、算法监测、数据集" 等AI词汇都会成为敏感词，因此我创建了该仓库。

本仓库为 AI 开发工作的数据和模型文件备份仓库，仓库为私有，仅用于我个人的开发记录与数据备份。
作为 AI 开发者，我的日常工作会持续产出大量中间文件、训练数据、模型权重等，这些都是与项目紧密相关的研发产物。本仓库中的所有文件均由我本人开发、生成或组织，完全用于技术研究、模型迭代和备份目的，不包含任何侵权、违法内容。
我也在其他公开平台（如 Hugging Face、GitHub 公开仓库）定期发布部分最终模型，供社区下载与复现。
✅ 请不要将本仓库误认为是滥用 Release 功能或非法文件托管仓库。
如果本仓库的内容在使用上有任何问题，或触发了 GitHub 平台的误判机制，请通过邮件联系我：📧 imomb.top@gmail.com
我将第一时间配合调整文件结构、清理无效内容，确保合规使用 GitHub 服务。请勿直接封禁仓库。
谢谢理解与支持 🙏
