### US - English Version (Repository Description)

Background statement:

Due to the Chinese Communist Party's data censorship policies, even terms such as "AI", "model training", "AI algorithms", "algorithm monitoring", and "datasets" are often treated as sensitive keywords. As a result, I created this repository.

1. This repository is a **private backup space for model and data files** produced during my daily AI development work.
2. It is used solely for **research, development tracking, and versioned storage** of training results.
3. As an AI developer, I frequently generate large numbers of intermediate outputs, datasets, and model checkpoints. All content stored here is directly related to machine learning projects I work on, and is either authored, generated, or organized by me. There is no illegal, infringing, or inappropriate material hosted in this repository.
Final and cleaned versions of selected models may be released publicly on platforms such as Hugging Face or in my public GitHub repositories.
4. **Please do not interpret this repository as misuse of GitHub Releases or a file dump**.
5. **If there's ever any concern about the repository's usage or content, please contact me by email before taking any action**: 📧 imomb.top@gmail.com | 🌱 I am fully willing to cooperate with any request to restructure, remove, or migrate content in order to remain compliant with GitHub's Terms of Service. **Please avoid directly suspending the repository**. Thank you very much for your understanding and support 🙏
